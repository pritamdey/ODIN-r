# Outlier DetectIon for Networks (ODIN) R Implementation

This repository contains our R implementation of the algorithm for detecting outliers in structural connectivity binary adjacency matrices using ODIN (Outlier DetectIon for Networks), which we developed in our paper, [Outlier Detection for Multi-Network Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06398). 

The repository contains the directory data which contains a toy dataset for fitting with ODIN and the lobe and hemisphere locations of every ROI. It also contains the following R files built as a local R project.

<!---
- ODIN: The main functionality of this implementation
  - ODIN.py :  all relevant functions for fitting the model and calculating the influence.
  - helper_functions.py : contains some tools to construct some of the matrices needed to fit and visualize the data.
  - simulation_generation_functions.py file is for simulating data from our model.
- simulation_runtime.py does the runtime simulations shown in our paper
- simulation_ownmodel_boxplots.py generates the boxplots in our paper
- simulation_ownmodel_sen_spe.py can be used to generate the sensitivity/specificity table shown for our model in the paper.
- main.py shows the step by step fitting of our model

There is also an Python implementation of this project [here](https://github.com/pritamdey/ODIN-python).
